## What This System Does

- Parses and cleans resume text at scale
- Extracts structured skills from unstructured content
- Classifies candidates into 42 job-role categories with 98.75% accuracy
- Ranks candidates against a job description using cosine similarity
- Presents results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard

## ML Pipeline

```
Raw Resumes (10,000)
    → Data Cleaning & Normalisation
    → TF-IDF Vectorisation (3,000 / 5,000 features)
    → Model Training (SVM / RF / LR / XGBoost)
    → Candidate Classification (42 categories)
    → Cosine Similarity Matching
    → Composite Scoring (60% match + 20% experience + 20% skills)
    → Ranked Candidate Shortlist
```
